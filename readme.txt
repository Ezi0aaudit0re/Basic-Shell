This is the implementation of Project 1 for CS575 

The program is written in C++


We use g++ as a compiler

Follow the following steps - 

g++ project.cpp helper.cpp


We run the program using ./a.out 

Implementation of chdir():

We change the current working directory of bash

We execute the chdir command using -> cd /

The program links to commands in refrence to root 
Therefore a command such as ~/Desktop would give an error 
A command such as -> cd /Users/<user> would work
